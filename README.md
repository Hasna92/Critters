# Critters
A simulation of a world with a unique set of rules in which critter objects exist. These can eat, move, and reproduce in every "time step" of the simulated world and each is unique by some other attributes and rules as well

The project helps understanding of concepts and tools like Java fx, threads, animation, synchronization, and detailed object-oriented design.

Feel free to download, compile, run, and recreate to bolster understanding in any of these concepts! Detailed descriptions are in the comments of the program.
